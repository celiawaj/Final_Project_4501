# Final_Project_4501

Project for Fall 2023 for Tools for Analytics

## Project Group 22

## Project Description

In this project, we have developed a comprehensive analysis framework focused on urban data from New York City. Integrating datasets from Zillow and NYC's Open Data, we created a PostgreSQL database to explore and visualize relationships between rental prices, urban greenery (tree counts), and public complaints (311 data). A key aspect of our work involves handling geographic information, allowing us to analyze and visualize spatial data patterns. We have meticulously processed geographical location data to provide insights into the spatial distribution of trees and 311 complaints across the city. Our implementation covers the entire data pipeline - from data acquisition, cleaning, and geographical information processing to database management, insightful query execution, and spatial visualization. This project offers a multifaceted view of urban living, revealing patterns and correlations between the cost of living, environmental factors, and the frequency and types of urban complaints, all through the lens of their geographical contexts.
