**Project Group 22**

Project for Fall 2023 for Tools for Analytics

## Project Description

In this project, we have developed a comprehensive analysis framework focused on data from New York City. Integrating datasets from Zillow and NYC's Open Data, we created a PostgreSQL database to explore and visualize the attributes of rental prices, urban greenery (tree counts), and public complaints (311 data) and the relationships among them. A key aspect of our work involves handling geographic information, allowing us to analyze and visualize spatial data patterns. We have processed geographical location data to provide insights into the spatial distribution of trees and 311 complaints across the city. Our implementation covers the entire data pipeline - from data acquisition, cleaning, and geographical information processing to database management, insightful query execution, and multiple visualization. This project offers a multifaceted view of urban living, revealing patterns and correlations between the cost of living, environmental factors, and the frequency and types of complaints.
